[日本語](/about)


I'm a full-stack engineer in Tokyo, Japan, and implementing real-time grphics content and tools with rich graphics such as AR, VR, visualization and simulation is my strength. 

My day-to-day work includes writing backend APIs, developing tools using Firebase and React, and creating interactive content using WebGL.

I use Photoshop, Affinity Design, After Effect and Blender for prototyping.

In weekends, I spends my time learning about competition programming and machine learning.I've just finished [Machine Learning course at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/SGJHB7UGJNB9?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharebutton_course). 


Please feel free to contace me via email. 

Thank you.

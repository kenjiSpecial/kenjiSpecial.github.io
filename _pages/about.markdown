Iâ€™m Kenji Saito from Japan, live in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I'm working as the webgl developer in [Superhero Cheesecake](http://superherocheesecake.com/), the digital agency in Amsterdam.

I like to make interactive things with coding. I use JavaScript and shader for works. I also use C#, C++ and python besides JavaScript and shader for my personal project.

I also use Unity/UE4 and Blender for my personal project.

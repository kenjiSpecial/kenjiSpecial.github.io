I created my portfolio every year not because of showing my works, but because of what I want to do this year.

I focused on webgl and glsl from Speptember 2015, I'm interesting more and more for the richer and more dynamic expression with WebGL.

I made the portfolio in 2016 with only WebGl, I change its special content [http://kenji-special.tv/special](http://kenji-special.tv/special) every month.

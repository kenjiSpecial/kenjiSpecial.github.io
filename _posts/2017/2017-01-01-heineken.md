    <h4>Overview in Visual</h4>

    <p>
    I can seprate 3 objects in this webgl stuff.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Globe</li>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>UI component between webgl globe and dom</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Globe</h5>
    <p>
    Globe is made up of four component, inner globe, outside globe, particle from globe, marker.
    </p>
    <p>I made shader material material for inside globe. it change its alpha based on the distance between camera. if some vertice is far from camera, its opacity is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also made shader material for outside globe. outside globe is only visible when they are top left or bottom right 
    </p>
    <p>
    tons of particles from globe emitted from globe like bubble of beer. I used gpgpu to calculate the velocity and position of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    marker of city is visible, when they are in front of camera.
    </p>

    <h5>Background</h5>

    <p>Background is composed of star, nebula, godray, flare from globe</p>
    <p>star is located outside of globe. it stretched when dragging fast. </p>
    <p>I made nebular with transparent perlin noise texture and plane mesh.</p>
    <p>I made flare from globe, and gorday with single shader material.</p>

    <h5>UI component between webgl globe and dom</h5>

    <p>I made transparent gradient arrow which connect between city marker in globe and frontend ui component. transparent gradient arrow</p>

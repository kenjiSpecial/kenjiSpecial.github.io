    <p>I changed my portfolio every year(<a href=" http://portfolio2016.herokuapp.com/">portfolio in 2016</a>). I did design and coding by myself, made something werid for my portfolio. I did three chanllenges for my portfolio.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>make 3d model including rigging and animation.</li>
        <li>You can interact with all keybard action and mouse action.</li>
        <li>make several variations with my portfolio and its content in 2017</li>
    </ol> 

    <p>The theme of the po kyeboard </p>

    <h5>3D model</h5>
    <p>
    I used blender for making 3D model and  three.plugin for three.js exporter to use webgl. </p>

    <p>I made simple hand model like mouse curson in browser. 
    There are 3 states of hand action: normal, rollover, and click.
    I added rig for hand, and made animation for both based on hand model.
    </p>

    <p>
    I made key model for keyboard. some key has two state: normal and rollover.
    </p>

    <h5>WebGL(three.js)</h5>

    <p>
    My portfolio site is pure webgl website. You can interact with keyboard or custom 3d cursor.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you click work with the custom cursor or type 'w' or 'e' or 'r' or 'k',  work scene is overlayed. 'about' page works in same way.
    </p>

    <h5>Variations</h5>

    <p>I wanted to use my portfolio as the boilerplate. That means I can add several variation to it.</p>

    <p>You can see the variation from my portfolio or the links below. There is no contents updated for it. You can play with it.</>

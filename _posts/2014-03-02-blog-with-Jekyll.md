[Jekyll][jekyll] make your text into static static website and blow. We don't need database. we can host free with Github.
You can select text style from HTML, Markdown, Liquid. You can make categories, tags for your blog.



##Why Jekyll?
I used Wordpress for my blog. Wordpress is good cms, tehre are a lot of cool free theme. Also it's easy to customize and many, many function.

I was tired of its flexibility and function, because I'm lazy person and it's hard to concentrate what I have to write on its editor. What I want for the editor is the `simplicity`.

Simple editor for cms is text eidtor like `Sublime Text App`. It looks simple and orgnize and clean, best function to make text or code.

In Jekyll, you can make you text in your content. You can use your favorite editor or IDE. I don't need to worried about annoying wordpress editor anymore.

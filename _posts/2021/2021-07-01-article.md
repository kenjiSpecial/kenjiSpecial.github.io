    3D models are created from aerial photographs using a technique called
    photogrammetry and can be viewed interactively as article content.
  </p>
  <p>
    We developed a software called 3D Content Editor so that reporters and
    designers can work on this project as a team. 3D models can be uploaded by
    3D designers, and the uploaded 3D models can be used by reporters to write
    text. up and publish to test and production environments.

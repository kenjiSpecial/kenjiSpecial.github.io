I started to learn Clojure from last Month.

I'm interested in what it is functional programing.

The syntax of functional programing is very exciting and interesting to me.

The more I kenw clojure, I want to use more for my personal project.

In the funture, I'm not sure, and I'm not much familiar with clojure.

So I started to use Clojurescript today. And I referred to several tutorial to begin it.
